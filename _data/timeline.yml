- title: Volunteer - Illini Fighting Hunger
  from: August 2021
  to: December 2021
  description: Devoted a semester to actively contributing to Illini Fighting Hunger, a dedicated organization committed to addressing food insecurity within our community. Engaged in volunteer and collaborative efforts in which we distributed packages to food pantries, and prepared fundraising events in an effort to support the organization's mission of alleviating hunger and fostering positive change. This volunteer work was very impactful for me, and got me into thinking about how I could contribute more than just my time to an initiative I believe in.
