- title: Outreach Coordinator at Carle Foundation Hospital
  from: August 2024
  to: December 2024
  description: As an outreach coordinator at Carle Health, I helped improve the clinical outcomes and participation of members who have a chronic condition and have not followed up on it in a year or more. By administering care to these patients, our team is able to maximize participation and get patients the care they need. Additionally, I developed and maintained detailed reports on initiatives created by our team, focusing on tracking key metrics related to patient outreach and engagement. By implementing targeted process enhancements in patient scheduling and outreach, I increased the number of completed appointments, significantly boosting overall patient satisfaction. These efforts not only optimized operational efficiency but also strengthened our commitment to delivering high-quality care to the community. I also utilized Excel to track in real time the quality of care patients are receiving, which gives me insight into pressure points that may exist within our team or even the system as a whole. Overall, I helped the team create an optimized participation rate and identify key struggles backed with data.

- title: Experience Intern at Carle Foundation Hospital
  from: May 2024
  to: August 2024
  description: As a Data Science intern at Carle, I focused on the quality of patient care as part of the Carle experience team, focusing on all aspects of the patient experience. One of the bigger projects I worked on was reworking the infrastructure of the company’s intranet system. This system had out of date information, so I focused on rebranding the intranet to better reflect the intuitive nature of Carle. I created a different system for cataloguing information, and creating cards to better reflect the content inside them. Another aspect of my internship was processing NPS health data, to improve patient care outcomes. By creating dashboards and reporting these to stakeholders quarterly, I was able to cut down on 3 programs that were creating substantial loss for the company. This not only included reporting, but also generating clean data for those reports, and carefully implementing a dashboard to present. Also, I was tasked with helping source a new language translation service company to partner with Carle, to assist with both over-the-phone, in-person, and virtual translation services. This won’t come into play until the end of 2025, so I will not be able to see the results. However, the accumulation of my research and sourcing has yielded great success initially, by demonstrating to stakeholders that more beneficial, cost-effective company’s leveraging AI tools could handle similar call volumes with as much as a 20% reduction in cost. Some lower level tasks I did was run SQL queries to support data analysis and visualization. Lastly, I regularly assisted with creating python scripts and data exploration regarding patient care.

    Ending with a published paper in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article/8/Supplement_1/647/7937336">Oxford Academic</a>, as well as the Gerontological Society of America, my journey through AdaptLab has been meaningful, fulfilling, and self-discovering. I first joined AdaptLab in the fall of 2021, where we came up with ideas for how to answer the question: How can technology, specifically AI, be used to make older adult life better? By brainstorming this question and diving into literature, we were able to come up with the basis of a study aimed to answer this exact question.

    <br><br>


    After two years of researching similar topics, we decided to launch the fireplace study, which involved over 54 participants in a qualitative, 6 month study, which tested emotional responses to requests for voice assistance while completing mind games on a smart technology device. This study showed that those with positive interactions with the voice assistant were more likely to feel that the voice assistant understood them than those with negative or no unscripted interactions. Additionally, participants with positive sentiments toward voice assistants preffered human-like features and felt they could use voice assistants to accomplish tasks. The aim of the study was to examine how interactions with technology influence older adult's attitudes toward it. This study was the longest, complex dedication of time and effort, and I am quite proud of all of our work at AdaptLab.
