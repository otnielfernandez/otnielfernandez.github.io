          <h2>Outreach Coordinator at Carle Foundation Hospital</h2>
          <h6 class="date">August 2024 — December 2024</h6>
          <p>As an outreach coordinator at Carle Health, I helped improve the clinical outcomes and participation of members who have a chronic condition and have not followed up on it in a year or more. By administering care to these patients, our team is able to maximize participation and get patients the care they need. Additionally, I developed and maintained detailed reports on initiatives created by our team, focusing on tracking key metrics related to patient outreach and engagement. By implementing targeted process enhancements in patient scheduling and outreach, I increased the number of completed appointments, significantly boosting overall patient satisfaction. These efforts not only optimized operational efficiency but also strengthened our commitment to delivering high-quality care to the community. I also utilized Excel to track in real time the quality of care patients are receiving, which gives me insight into pressure points that may exist within our team or even the system as a whole. Overall, I helped the team create an optimized participation rate and identify key struggles backed with data.</p>

          <h2>Experience Intern at Carle Foundation Hospital</h2>
          <h6 class="date">May 2024 — August 2024</h6>
          <p>As a Data Science intern at Carle, I focused on the quality of patient care as part of the Carle experience team, focusing on all aspects of the patient experience. One of the bigger projects I worked on was reworking the infrastructure of the company’s intranet system. This system had out of date information, so I focused on rebranding the intranet to better reflect the intuitive nature of Carle. I created a different system for cataloguing information, and creating cards to better reflect the content inside them. Another aspect of my internship was processing NPS health data, to improve patient care outcomes. By creating dashboards and reporting these to stakeholders quarterly, I was able to cut down on 3 programs that were creating substantial loss for the company. This not only included reporting, but also generating clean data for those reports, and carefully implementing a dashboard to present. Also, I was tasked with helping source a new language translation service company to partner with Carle, to assist with both over-the-phone, in-person, and virtual translation services. This won’t come into play until the end of 2025, so I will not be able to see the results. However, the accumulation of my research and sourcing has yielded great success initially, by demonstrating to stakeholders that more beneficial, cost-effective company’s leveraging AI tools could handle similar call volumes with as much as a 20% reduction in cost. Some lower level tasks I did was run SQL queries to support data analysis and visualization. Lastly, I regularly assisted with creating python scripts and data exploration regarding patient care.</p>

          <h6 class="date">August 2023 — May 2024</h6>
          <p>In my role at the Illinois Leadership Center (ILC), I specialized in leveraging data analysis techniques and statistical software to support various programs and services. I analyzed complex datasets to extract valuable insights, enabling evidence-based decision-making within the organization. I produced comprehensive data reports, visualizations, and presentations to highlight the impact of ILC workshops and programs. Additionally, I designed and implemented research projects focusing on leadership initiatives. Lastly, I worked on redesigning the Master’s in Bioengineering program as part of a research initiative started at the ILC to promote leadership and innovation in its graduate programs.</p>

          <p>As a tutor/mentor for students, I provided academic support and guidance to help my students overcome educational challenges. I worked closely with each child to assess their individual learning needs and tailored my approach accordingly. This involved assisting them with homework assignments, explaining difficult concepts in a clear and accessible manner, and providing additional practice exercises to reinforce learning. Beyond academics, I served as a mentor and a role model, offering encouragement, motivation, and emotional support to help build their confidence and self-esteem. I also strived to foster a positive and nurturing learning environment where students felt valued and empowered to succeed. Additionally, I collaborated with parents and teachers to ensure a holistic approach to their educational development, advocating for resources and opportunities that promoted their long-term success. Through my dedication and commitment, I aimed to make a meaningful impact in the lives of these children, helping them realize their full potential despite the challenges they faced outside of school.</p>

          <h2><a href="http://adapt.kch.illinois.edu/">AdaptLab</a></h2>
          <h6 class="date">August 2021 — December 2024</h6>
          <p>Ending with a published paper in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/innovateage/article/8/Supplement_1/647/7937336">Oxford Academic</a>, as well as the Gerontological Society of America, my journey through AdaptLab has been meaningful, fulfilling, and self-discovering. I first joined AdaptLab in the fall of 2021, where we came up with ideas for how to answer the question: How can technology, specifically AI, be used to make older adult life better? By brainstorming this question and diving into literature, we were able to come up with the basis of a study aimed to answer this exact question.
<br /><br />

After two years of researching similar topics, we decided to launch the fireplace study, which involved over 54 participants in a qualitative, 6 month study, which tested emotional responses to requests for voice assistance while completing mind games on a smart technology device. This study showed that those with positive interactions with the voice assistant were more likely to feel that the voice assistant understood them than those with negative or no unscripted interactions. Additionally, participants with positive sentiments toward voice assistants preffered human-like features and felt they could use voice assistants to accomplish tasks. The aim of the study was to examine how interactions with technology influence older adult's attitudes toward it. This study was the longest, complex dedication of time and effort, and I am quite proud of all of our work at AdaptLab.

          <h6 class="date">August 2021 — December 2021</h6>
          <p>Devoted a semester to actively contributing to Illini Fighting Hunger, a dedicated organization committed to addressing food insecurity within our community. Engaged in volunteer and collaborative efforts in which we distributed packages to food pantries, and prepared fundraising events in an effort to support the organization's mission of alleviating hunger and fostering positive change. This volunteer work was very impactful for me, and got me into thinking about how I could contribute more than just my time to an initiative I believe in.</p>

          <p>I was admitted to the University of Illinois on the Illinois Promise in 2020. This prestigious scholarship is given to students who show academic promise and willingness to learn, and covers the cost of tuition and housing for low-income, first-generation students who have high academic performance. This, combined with the acceptance into the school of Applied Health Sciences, gave me a hopeful feeling that I was on the right path when choosing public health.</p>
