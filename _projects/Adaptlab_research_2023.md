### **About:**
This research project explores how older adults interact with voice assistants (VAs) and how these interactions influence their adoption of the technology. We utilized a home-simulation study wherein participants engaged with our Voice Assistant (named RAVA) to perform various tasks such as gameplay, storytelling, and reflection. Data was recorded through transcribed recorded conversations, sentiment analysis, and human-computer interaction (HCI) responses. Lastly, there was a quantitative and qualitative approach to analyze participant responses and categorize their sentiment towards VAs.

### **Key Findings:**
- **Positive interactions** with the voice assistant (named RAVA) led participants to feel more understood and increased their willingness to use the technology.  
- **Negative interactions** were linked to frustration and perceptions that VAs were not useful or did not improve quality of life.  
- Participants with positive sentiments toward VAs preferred human-like features and believed they could use VAs to accomplish tasks.  

### **Conclusions:**
- Personalization of VAs for older adults may improve adoption.  
- Addressing **concerns about usefulness, frustration, and confidence** in using VAs could help improve engagement.  
- Future research should explore **long-term** VA interactions to confirm findings.  

This study highlights the importance of **user-friendly and adaptable VA designs** to encourage adoption among older adults.
