### **About:**
This research poster explores how caregiver relationship dynamics with their patients influence preferences for mobile health technology features related to fall prevention. The study, conducted using secondary data analysis from a Fall Prevention Survey in Mainland China, examines differences between primary and non-primary caregivers.

### **Key Findings:**
- Some things we noted for primary caregivers are that they experience more relational strain and show less interest in digitized fall prevention features. Additionally, non-primary caregivers exhibit a positive relationship between criticism and preferences for both digitized and social features of technology. Relational strain being higher means there is a greater importance on technology features.

### **Conclusions:**
- Socio-emotional selectivity theory explains differences in health technology preferences among caregivers.
- The relationship quality between caregiver and care receiver affects the adoption of mobile health technology.
- Future research should examine relational strain's impact on caregiver rankings of health technology.

### **Implications:**
- Findings have implications for designing and implementing mobile health technologies for caregivers.
- Results suggest cultural factors (such as family orientation) may influence caregiver preferences.

### **Limitations:**
- Data was collected only in Mainland China.
- Secondary data analysis may not be the optimal method for studying caregiver preferences.
